## Description of Approach

This project was implemented using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and Typescript and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

[Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/) used for styling

My implementation is mobile responsive.
On mobile screen, click on the black dot at the top left to view the side navigation

## Limitations

With more time, I would have;

1. Used more componenting measures
2. implemented a Table component for the Table part
3. Used a font closer to the design
4. Focused more on accessiblity

## Setup instruction

- Clone the repository to your local machine
- install the packages using:

```bash
npm install
```

- start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
